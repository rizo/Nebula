    Software triggers are enqueued directly as interrupts with a given message.

    the interrupt index to be invoked. *)

(** Execute an iteration of the DCPU-16.

    First, dequeue an interrupt (if one is waiting) and transfer control to the
    interrupt handler.

    Next, decode the next instruction from memory at the program counter.

    Finally, check for an interrupt trigger generated by the instruction and
    execute it. *)
